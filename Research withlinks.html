<h4>Job Market Paper</h4>

<p align='justify'><b>Abstract</b>
: I analyze how current pricing and inventory practices of grocery retailers contribute to excessive retail food waste. As of present day, these firms largely engage in static pricing (as opposed to dynamic, or revenue management) and maintain high inventories. Using data from a large Midwestern grocery retailer, I show that that high margins, surprisingly low disposal costs, and demand uncertainty are the primary drivers of high waste. I then ask why these firms tend to not engage in clearance sales. To answer this, I estimate consumer demand for perishables and model the firm's optimal supply decision and show that while dynamic pricing tends to effectively reduce waste, under current market conditions it does not generate sufficient incremental profits for firms to voluntarily adopt such a practice. The externality of this high waste has attracted regulatory scrutiny, as the cost is borne by society. I then show that the returns to dynamic pricing increase under a regulatory regime that bans waste, as has been implemented in Massachusetts and California. I simulate a ban for Milwaukee, WI, and show how the two policies are complementary and effective at solving the problem of excess waste: When disposal costs are internalized, returns to RM increase from 7% to 15%, and waste reduction further reduces another 11%. In particular, I show that the firm can implement a Pareto-improving policy by switching to RM, decreasing carbon emissions by 5%.

<h4>With Jean-Pierre Dube and Bart Bronnenberg</h4>
	<p align='justify'>
	<b>Abstract</b>: We document the effects on quality perceptions and on long term purchase habits of blindly tasting leading national brands and their private label counterparts side by side in three different categories. Consumers' state that they perceive the quality gap between national brands and private labels to become smaller after the blind taste test. Using purchase data on the same set of consumers before and after the taste test, we find that the preference for the private label brands increases in the short-, medium-, and long-run after exposure to the blind taste test. However, the effects diminish over time. Evidence from estimating a full structural demand system in one category is consistent with these findings.</p><p>Keywords: product quality beliefs, national brands, private labels, consumer choice
